        <h3>What is ResumeBuddy?</h3>
        <p>ResumeBuddy is a webapp that helps people get and provide feedback on each other's resumes. Currently,
            people may not have access to good quality reviewers for their resumes. If someone is looking for review
            from someone already working in their field of interest, they can use ResumeBuddy to be connected to
            one! ResumeBuddy offers a free virtual professional development service to anyone who may not otherwise
            have access to it. </p>
        <h3>Who do we build for?</h3>
        <p>ResumeBuddy is for anyone seeking critique and tips from qualified reviewers to help improve their
            resume. It is also for people who want to volunteer to help review resumes and give back to the job
            seeking community.</p>
        <h3>How does it Work?</h3>
        <p> To get your resume reviewed, sign in and fill out a Reviewee Form. If you are looking to review resumes, fill out
            the Reviewer Form. Both forms will ask specific questions that will allow our algorithm to pair you based on your
            preferences from the form. Click on a form down below to get started! </p>
